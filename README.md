This project is a simple example of a **[GO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) Tournament Registration System**.  
It is built entirely using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **jQuery**.

---

## Project Description

- All player data is defined as a static **JSON array** (`playerList`) within the JavaScript file.
- Players are listed in a table.
- New players can be added using the form fields.
- Each player can be deleted with a single click.
- The status of each player row (`Approved` or `Pending`) can be toggled instantly using a switch.
- The row‚Äôs glassmorphism background color changes automatically depending on the status.
- Basic jQuery event examples are used: adding a player, deleting a player, changing player status.
 

## Note

- The `localStorage` feature has **not been added**, as required by the case. Data is only stored temporarily in the page memory.

- [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) ‚Äî Player names have been sourced from here.
